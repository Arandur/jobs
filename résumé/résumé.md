## Mission Statement

I am seeking a mid- to senior-level engineering position in which I can leverage my skills to create or enhance a
product that improves the lives of our customers. I'd prefer a position with focus on backend infrastructure and site
reliability; I hope in the next two years to specialize as a Site Reliability Engineer. My ideal company will have a
strong focus on individual and social responsibility, with growth opportunities for engineers who work hard and prove
themselves.

## Employment History

### Venture Capital

- Segovia Technology: Senior Software Engineer, Apr 2020 - Dec 2020
- Braze: Senior Software Engineer, Oct 2019 - Mar 2020
- Spotify: Backend Software Engineer, Jun 2019 - Sep 2019

In these positions, I was faced with the challenge of adapting myself to a fast-paced, agile engineering
environment—something I had not experienced during my work as a government contractor. 

Among my accomplishments were the following:

- I was instrumental in building strategies to convert a monolithic Ruby on Rails application to microservice
  architecture.
- I served as a valuable resource for increasing security, accessibility, and efficiency of revenue-generating
  applications, reducing our costs significantly while increasing our potential customer base.
- I conscientiously balanced the concerns of managing our users' PII securely, while creating value for our clients.
- I have been a vocal advocate for social justice, leveraging my experiences as a trans woman to improve the culture of
  wherever I have gone.

### Government Contracting

- L3 Harris: Embedded Software Engineer, Nov 2017 - Jun 2019
- Lockheed Martin: Support Software Engineer, Aug 2017 - Nov 2017
- MITRE: Software Developer, Jun 2015 - Aug 2017
- MITRE: Student Intern, Jun 2014 - Jun 2015

In these positions, I learned how to translate my innate talent as an writer-of-code into the hard skills I would need
in order to be an effective engineer. I frequently impressed my managers and peers with my technical knowledge, and
became the person-to-ask for difficult questions within my areas of expertise. 

Among my accomplishments were the following:

- I singlehandedly crafted libraries for non-engineer subject matter experts, to tighten their feedback loops and
  increase company efficiency.
- I served as an intra-team advisor and consultant, elucidating technical concepts for non-technical co-workers and
  answering complex technical questions for fellow engineers.
- I leveraged my deep understanding of efficient multithreaded software engineering to build analysis and ingestion
  tools for large amounts of government data, allowing our sponsor to save lives and prevent tragedies.

### Education

- California State University: Bachelors in Computer Science, Aug 2015
- San Bernardino Valley College: Associate in Mathematics, Jan 2012

Mathematics and computer science have always been twin passions of mine, and I've frequently been able to leverage my
understanding of abstract mathematical concepts in order to build more maintainable and efficient code. Not every job
requires a mathematician's mind, but I excel in those that do.

### Languages

- Expert level: C, C++, Python, Java
- Intermediate level: Kotlin, Rust, Ruby
- Beginner level: Go, Scala, Clojure, x86-64
